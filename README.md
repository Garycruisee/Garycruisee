#### About Me!
I am an individual who places a high value on expertise and strives for excellence in all of my endeavors. My aspiration is to make meaningful contributions to society through the application of my skills and knowledge.

I have worked in fast moving consumer goods. Managing raw material to finished goods, distribution, making marketing strategy for offline and offline store, & handling feedbacks from consumers and improving the brand.

At present, I am actively engaged in pursuing a career as a software developer. My focus within this field encompasses both frontend and backend development. For frontend development, I have gained proficiency in JavaScript and TypeScript, and well-versed in utilizing the react framework. On the backend, I have honed my skills by working with frameworks such as Nest.js and Express.js.

This combination of expertise from my past experience and technical skills has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development. In addition to my strong communication and teamwork. I believe that I can be a well-versed software developer who can tackle many tasks at once. I am dedicated to further expanding my knowledge and skill set in this ever-evolving field to excel as a software developer.
